## Backing up shortcuts


## Known limitations

* Super Launcher saves the shortcuts in the user's AppData folder. This means when running Super Launcher in a portable environment (for example: from a USB thumb drive), Super Launcher will not save the shortcuts in that environment. *See: [backing up shortcuts](#backing-up-shortcuts), for a guide on backing up the shortcuts.*
