# About



Super ADD is a MDT (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit) extension that displays a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to a user running a LTI (Lite Touch Installation) that allows them to select / generate a computer name and description for Active Directory.

Super ADD also creates the computer accounts as soon as the user selects "Save" to prevent computer objects from being over-written from parallel instances of LTI.
