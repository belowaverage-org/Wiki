# About
> Super Start is a program designed to [bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping) other programs like Point of Sale software or Kiosk software. Super Start acts as a fail safe in the event Kiosk or Point of Sale software crashes or is accidentally exited by showing a splash screen with a timer (giving the user an oportunity to enter an over-ride pin) then re-launching the Kiosk / Point of Sale software.
# Setup
> To begin setting up Super Start, first you must run the program; doing so will generate a `SuperStart.xml` file. To exit Super Start with defaults applied, exit the CMD window that says "Start Process", press anywhere on the splash screen, and enter the pin `1234`. See below what the generated SuperStart.xml file should look like.
## SuperStart.xml
```xml
